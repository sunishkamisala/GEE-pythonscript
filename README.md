# GEE-pythonscript

A sample python code to export image windows around the training points using Google Earth Engine (GEE) can be found here. This script uses Python 
to access GEE and uses NAIP as the high resolution image to be used for training. Note that the script makes a reference to training points that live as a GEE asset.
